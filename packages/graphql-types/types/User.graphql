A `Relationship` is a distinct set of accounts (and agreements) between a specific
person or company and a financial institution. For example, a person may have a
group of accounts that are shared with a spouse while also having independent
accounts for a sole proprietorship. That same person may also have access to the
accounts of a corporation which are associated via another relationship.
